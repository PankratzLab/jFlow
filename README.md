Genvisis
====================
Efficient Visualization of Genomic data

----------------------
Genvisis is a robust software package that takes advantage of unique compressed data structures to efficiently process, assess quality of, analyze, and visualize the intensity data from GWAS arrays.

Specialized algorithms are used to call CNVs, and each algorithm uses its own approach. Genvisis allows a CNV to be inspected by visualizing boundaries overlaid with probe intensities.

Building with Maven
=====================

Genvisis uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to manage its dependencies, build process and more.

Genvisis is structured as a [multi-module](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Project_Aggregation) Maven project with the following structure:

| pom-genvisis  
| '-- Logicle  
| '-- CFCS  
| '-- Genvisis  
| '-- Genv-experimental  
| '-- Genv-deprecated  
| '-- Assembly  

The key things to know about this structure are:

* The top-level `pom-genvisis` pom.xml manages the build order of submodules and all dependency versions.
* The `Assembly` project controls how the bundled `Genvisis.jar` is created. Any dependencies to this project will be included in the final .jar, and the pom.xml version number is used as the overall application version.
* Each individual project is laid out according to the [standard Maven directory layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html).

## Getting started

### Command line

For building on the command line, simply run `mvn` from the top-level `pom-genvisis` level. This will call the [install goal](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) by default - building all modules and copying them to your [local Maven repository](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html).

### Eclipse

1. Import the top-level Genvisis directory as an [Existing Maven Project](http://javapapers.com/java/import-maven-project-into-eclipse/). Eclipse will create projects automatically for `pom-genvisis` and all sub-modules.

That's it! You can now develop Genvisis code.

#### Building the Genvisis application

Just like on the command line, to build the `genvisis.jar`, run the `pom-genvisis` project [as a Maven build](https://books.sonatype.com/m2eclipse-book/reference/running-sect-running-maven-builds.html), and select the **install** goal.

All Maven output will print in the `Console` tab. When complete, your `genvisis.jar` will be built in the `Assembly/target/` directory, per the standard directory layout.

#### Error: Project configuration is not up-to-date with pom.xml

Maven `pom.xml`s are translated to Eclipse projects via the M2Eclipse plugin. Unfortunately, by default it does not automatically update settings when the `pom.xml` changes, resulting in these annoying errors popping up from time to time.

While it is safe to simply update your project (e.g. with the [Quick Fix](http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcept-quickfix-assist.htm) feature), there is also an Eclipse preference to [automatically update](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/release-notes-16.html#new-experimental-auto-45-update-configuration-feature) - which can save some time and confusion.

#### Creating a run configuration

For convenience, you can also [create a dedicated run configuration](https://www.genuitec.com/products/myeclipse/learning-center/maven/launch-maven4myeclipse-maven-run-setup-tutorial/#2_Creating_a_CustomMavenLaunch_Configuration) for the top-level `pom-genvisis` project.

Creating a run configuration will allow you to select the Maven build from the [Run toolbar button](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/running_and_debugging_2_0), and also allows customization of properties (in contrast to the global properties declared in your `settings.xml`).

#### Changing main class or jar name

The Assembly project uses two parameters to determine how to build the final `.jar`:

* `outname`  - name of the .jar, default: "genvisis"
* `mainClass` - fully qualified main class to run when executing the .jar, default: org.genvisis.cnv.Launch

These parameters can be overridden [the standard Maven way](http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/running-sect-options.html) to customize the output .jar.

Additionally, when creating a run configuration in Eclipse there is a section to override parameters, so you can use multiple run configurations to manage your different views of the Genvisis codebase.

A final option is to create a `pom.xml` that uses the `Assembly` pom as its parent and overrides these parameters. The advantage to this method is that it provides a tangible `pom.xml` that implicitly documents the parameters, and can be shared with the community

## Automatic upload and copy

You can use Maven to automatically upload `genvisis.jar` to a remote location after each build, and/or copy the output file to a directory on your local filesystem. To enable this feature, create a `settings.xml` in your `${user.home}/.m2` directory with the following structure:

```xml
<settings>
	<profiles>
		<profile>
			<id>genvisis-upload</id>
			<properties>
				<!-- Uncomment and edit this line to enable post-build copy
				<genv.copy.path>path/to/output/dir/</genv.copy.path>
				-->

				<!-- Uncomment and edit these lines to enable post-build upload
				<genv.upload.exe>[p]scp</genv.upload.exe>
				<genv.upload.path>user[:pass]@host:/path/to/output/</genv.upload.path>
				-->
			</properties>
		</profile>
	</profiles>

	<activeProfiles>
		<activeProfile>genvisis-upload</activeProfile>
	</activeProfiles>
</settings>
```
This script needs to be modified for your particular setup (e.g., the upload application is typically `pscp` on Windows and `scp` on Linux)

Once the `genv.upload.path` is set, every time the `Assembly` component builds the `Install` step, it will use this information to scp `genvisis.jar` to the specified remote path.

### Note on passwords

You should not store your password in plaintext in this settings file. The best option is to [set up a public/private key pair](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys) with the server you are uploading to. Another option is encryption with Maven directly via [settings-security.xml](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html)

## Creating a native application

Genvisis uses the [JavaFX-maven-plugin](https://github.com/javafx-maven-plugin/javafx-maven-plugin) to create native bundles. This configuration is stored in the `Assembly` project's `pom.xml`, in the `jfx` profile. It can be activated by running:

```bash
mvn clean package -P jfx
```

from either the `/Assembly/` directory or the project base directory (containing Genvisis' top-level `pom.xml`).

This will create several outputs of interest:

Genvisis.git</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- _Assembly_</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- _target_</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- **genvisis.tar.gz** (compressed native app w/ runtime)</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- _jfx_</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- **app** (folder with jar + dependencies)</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- _native_</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- **genvisis** (folder with app + platform-specific runtime)</br>
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'-- **genvisis-xxx.[rpm|deb|exe|msi|app]** (platform-specific installer)</br>


Some notes:
* Native bundles will only be built for the local OS
* Each OS requires its own build tools to be installed (e.g. debian on Ubuntu, rpm on Linux, [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) for `.exe` or [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org/) for `.msi` on Windows)
* We recommend reading [the JavaFX tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/deployment/self-contained-packaging.htm) for more information about deployment options.
