Genvisis
====================
Efficient Visualization of Genomic data

----------------------
Genvisis is a robust software package that takes advantage of unique compressed data structures to efficiently process, assess quality of, analyze, and visualize the intensity data from GWAS arrays
Specialized algorithms are used to call CNVs, and each algorithm uses its own approach. Genvisis allows a CNV to be inspected by visualizing boundaries overlaid with probe intensities
