Genvisis
====================
Efficient Visualization of Genomic data

----------------------
Genvisis is a robust software package that takes advantage of unique compressed data structures to efficiently process, assess quality of, analyze, and visualize the intensity data from GWAS arrays
Specialized algorithms are used to call CNVs, and each algorithm uses its own approach. Genvisis allows a CNV to be inspected by visualizing boundaries overlaid with probe intensities

[//]: # (1.	Parse Illumina/Infimax/csv/:)
[//]: # (Load and parse micro array data (Create a new project);
[//]: # (2.	Extract Plots:)
[//]: # (Convert the data into a format that is)
[//]: # (3.	Slim Plots:)
[//]: # (An optional step to speed up the scatter plot for mid-size data)
[[//]: # (4.	Plots or Tools:)
[//]: # (Select the kind of analysis to run.)

[//]: # (While there are graphical software being so popular today, Genvisis provides some features that are not easily found elsewhere.)
[//]: # (Genvisis is a software product that Dr. Nathan Pankratz has developed for years. He started the project because he couldn’t find the right tool for his genetic research.)
